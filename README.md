# GoatExtrator
A program that accesses Gmail using the IMAP protocol to download shipping labels and commercial invoices sent by Goat.

Create a Gmail filter that adds all mails containing "Shipping label and instructions" in the subject to a folder called "labels" (can be changed). This ensures only mails from Goat will be read.
